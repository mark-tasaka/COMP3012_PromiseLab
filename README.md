# COMP3012_PromiseLab
This repository consists of a node.js lab I completed for a Node.js class I am taking at BCIT.  The code utilizes promises (as opposed to the standard Node.js callbacks). The objective of the lab is to read a menu.csv data, to reformate the data, which includes a 1.8 times price increase, and print the data to a txt file.
